## 📝 About

This project aims to provide practical and in-depth documentation for using two of the most popular Git-related tools:

- **Lazygit** 🌀: A terminal-based Git client that offers a fast and intuitive graphical user interface for managing Git repositories.
- **GitHub CLI** 🚀: A command-line interface to interact with GitHub, allowing you to handle pull requests, issues, releases, and more directly from your terminal.

## 💡 Motivation

Working with Git from the command line can be complex and time-consuming. This project was created to simplify version control workflows by providing detailed guides on tools that streamline Git operations:

- Lazygit helps visualize and manage Git commands with ease.
- GitHub CLI enables seamless interaction with GitHub repositories directly from the terminal.

These tools can greatly improve your development workflow, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer.
